# Requirement Analysis in Software Development. 
This Repository focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

### What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and managing requirements of a system to be developed. It serves as the foundation for the entire project because incorrect or incomplete requirements can lead to costly rework, delays, or even project failure.

This process involves:
- Eliciting Requirements – Collecting information from stakeholders, customers, and end-users.
- Analyzing Requirements – Understanding the feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
- Specifying Requirements – Writing detailed requirement specifications (e.g., SRS document).
- Validating Requirements – Ensuring requirements meet stakeholder needs and are achievable within constraints.

### **Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it forms the foundation for all subsequent stages. Without a clear understanding of requirements, the entire project is at risk of failure. Below are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is important:

---

#### **1. Prevents Misunderstandings and Miscommunication**
- **Description:**  
  Requirement Analysis ensures that both stakeholders and developers share a **common understanding** of the system’s objectives and functionalities.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Miscommunication often leads to **incorrect features**, wasted effort, and dissatisfied clients. Proper analysis creates clear, unambiguous documentation that all parties agree on.

---

#### **2. Reduces Cost and Time Overruns**
- **Description:**  
  Detecting and correcting requirement errors in the early stages is much cheaper than fixing them after development or deployment.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  According to industry studies, fixing a defect during design costs **10 times less** than fixing it after implementation. Thorough analysis minimizes **rework**, **delays**, and **budget overruns**.

---

#### **3. Improves Product Quality**
- **Description:**  
  Clear, well-documented requirements serve as the **blueprint** for design, development, and testing.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  It ensures the final product meets **functional** and **non-functional** requirements, resulting in a solution that aligns with user expectations and performs effectively under real-world conditions.

### **Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**

Requirement Analysis consists of several structured activities that help ensure the software meets stakeholder needs effectively. Below are the five key activities:

---

#### **1. Requirement Gathering**
- **Description:**  
  This is the initial step where information about the system is collected from stakeholders such as clients, end-users, and domain experts.  
- **Objective:**  
  To understand the **high-level needs**, **business goals**, and **expectations** of the project.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Stakeholder meetings  
  - Reviewing existing documents  
  - Market and competitor analysis  

---

#### **2. Requirement Elicitation**
- **Description:**  
  In this phase, the team **extracts detailed requirements** through interaction with stakeholders to uncover explicit and implicit needs.  
- **Objective:**  
  To identify both **functional** and **non-functional requirements** that might not be immediately obvious.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Interviews  
  - Brainstorming sessions  
  - Questionnaires and surveys  
  - Observation and workshops  

---

#### **3. Requirement Documentation**
- **Description:**  
  After gathering and eliciting requirements, they are formally documented in a structured format such as the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**.  
- **Objective:**  
  To create a **clear, comprehensive, and unambiguous record** of all requirements that will serve as a reference throughout the project.  
- **Key Outputs:**  
  - SRS Document  
  - Use case diagrams  
  - User stories  

---

#### **4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
- **Description:**  
  This step involves **analyzing requirements for completeness, feasibility, consistency, and priority**. Modeling is used to represent requirements visually for better understanding.  
- **Objective:**  
  To ensure requirements are logically organized, free of conflicts, and achievable within given constraints.  
- **Tools & Techniques:**  
  - UML diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Class)  
  - Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)  
  - Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)  

---

#### **5. Requirement Validation**
- **Description:**  
  Validation ensures that the documented requirements **accurately reflect stakeholder needs** and are technically and financially feasible.  
- **Objective:**  
  To confirm that requirements are **correct, complete, and testable** before moving to the design phase.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Requirements review meetings  
  - Prototyping  
  - Walkthroughs and inspections
