# Requirement Analysis in Software Development. 
This Repository focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and managing requirements of a system to be developed. It serves as the foundation for the entire project because incorrect or incomplete requirements can lead to costly rework, delays, or even project failure.

This process involves:
- Eliciting Requirements – Collecting information from stakeholders, customers, and end-users.
- Analyzing Requirements – Understanding the feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
- Specifying Requirements – Writing detailed requirement specifications (e.g., SRS document).
- Validating Requirements – Ensuring requirements meet stakeholder needs and are achievable within constraints.
